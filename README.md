# Matplotlib-Challenge
This assignment tests our knowledge of Matplotlib.
The data is based off a drug tests done on mice by a phamarceutical company.
We are asked to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clincal study.
CSV files are included in repository.

Tasks done with the analysis:
•	Prepare the data.
•	Generate summary statistics.
•	Create bar charts and pie charts.
•	Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
•	Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
•	Calculate correlation and regression.

Per submission instructions:
Review all the figures and tables that you generated in this assignment. Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of your notebook.

Observations
1.	In regards to the summary statistics of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error, three drugs, Ketapril, Naftisol, and Stelasyn, had similar results as the placebo,  which may lead the researchers to question the effectiveness of each drug.
2.	Mice treated with the drugs Ramicane and Capomulin have the smaller tumor volume in comparison to the rest of the drugs in the analysis, which could mean those particular drugs are more effective at treating the tumors.
3.	 The drug, Propiva, had the least number of observed mouse timepoints.
